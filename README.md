## OBJECTIVES

1) Fuel efficiency: using ML to optimize a car's fuel consumption by analyzing data from sensors and adjusting the car's performance accordingly.
2) Explore and visualize the dataset.
3) Build a linear regression model to predict the prices of haundai cars.
4) Generate a set of insights and recommendations that will help the business.


## TOOLS

1) python

## PROCESS

1) First we have to analyse the data set 
2) rearranging and cleaning of data wiith the help of power numpy and pandas
3) EDA
4) running ml models
   
## CONCLUSION

In conclusion, the use of machine learning (ML) in the analysis of Hyundai cars can bring a wide range of benefits. By analyzing data from various sensors and other sources, ML can help to optimize the car's performance, improve its fuel efficiency, enhance its safety features, and even enable autonomous driving. Overall, the application of ML in the analysis of Hyundai cars can make them more efficient, reliable, and convenient to use, while also providing valuable insights that can be used to improve the overall design and production of Hyundai cars.

 ## PROBLEMS FACED
 
 1) Lots of null value to handle
 2) numbers were not clear
